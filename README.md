# NFL-Salary-Distribution-
This project analyzes the salary disparities between NFL running backs (RBs) and wide receivers (WRs), using regression analysis to assess how rushing and receiving yards correlate with player salaries and team success. By examining the efficiency of salary allocation, the project highlights a significant gap in how players are compensated relative to their contributions to wins. Utilizing R for data cleaning, regression modeling, and visualization, the project evaluates key performance metrics and presents actionable insights for optimizing salary distribution in the NFL. Key findings reveal that WRs are overvalued compared to RBs, despite both positions contributing similarly to team success.
